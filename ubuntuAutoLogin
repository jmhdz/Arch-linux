ubuntu start on command line

#nano /etc/default/grub
Find the line that says GRUB_CMLDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. By default it should have quotation marks with nothing in between. Add the word “text” within the quotation marks.

#update-grub

to start the GUI 
$startx

to go back to normal, just remove the word "text" leaving only the quotes, save and run # update-grub

To autologin on command line

To auto login user "bob" on first console terminal (tty1) edit file /etc/init/tty1.conf and replace last line:

exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1
with this:

exec /bin/login -f bob < /dev/tty1 > /dev/tty1 2>&1


Automatically login in text mode without specifying userid or password (untested)

Add -a <your-user-name> to the line:

exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1
in file /etc/init/tty1.conf

like so:

exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty6 -a gruber
/etc/init/tty1.conf is the upstart job that runs at the appropriate time to start the terminal session on tty1. Adding the -a option tells getty to call the login program with the -f option to sign that user in, bypassing the user prompt from getty and the password prompt from login.
